# PDFeditor
A small PDF editor that uses the python library PyPDF2

-Python Version used: 3.0+

-Python library used: PyPDF2

NOTE: Once downloaded, edit the EditPDF file to Perform tasks

-Current libraries built:

-MergePDF

-CutPDF

I hope to extend it to a fully functional PDF editor with GUI drag and drop functionalities.
